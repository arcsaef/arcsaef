As Antarctic regions increasingly face climate pressures (e.g., changing hydrology and heat waves), advancing capabilities to efficiently and non‐destructively monitor water content in moss communities becomes a key research priority. Because of the complexity induced by multiple micro‐climatic drivers and its fragility, tracking the evolution and responses of moss bed moisture requires monitoring methods that are non‐intrusive, efficient, and spatially significant, such as the use of unoccupied aerial systems (UAS). In this study, we combine a multi‐species drying laboratory experiment with short‐wave infrared (SWIR) spectroscopy analyses to first develop a Random Forest regression Model (RFM) capable of predicting Antarctic moss turf water content ({\\\\textasciitilde}5\\\\% error).

A significant recent element underpinning strategies for Antarctic conservation has been the development of a system of Antarctic Conservation Biogeographic Regions (ACBRs). The datasets supporting this classification are, however, dominated by eukaryotic taxa, with contributions from the bacterial domain restricted to Actinomycetota and Cyanobacteriota. Nevertheless, the ice-free areas of the Antarctic continent and the sub-Antarctic islands are dominated in terms of diversity by bacteria. Our study aims to generate a comprehensive phylogenetic dataset of Antarctic bacteria with wide geographical coverage on the continent and sub-Antarctic islands, to investigate whether bacterial diversity and distribution is reflected in the current ACBRs. \\n\\n\\nResults \\nSoil bacterial diversity and community composition did not fully conform with the ACBR classification. Although 19\\\\% of the variability was explained by this classification, the largest differences in bacterial community composition were between the broader continental and maritime Antarctic regions, where a degree of structural overlapping within continental and maritime bacterial communities was apparent, not fully reflecting the division into separate ACBRs. Strong divergence in soil bacterial community composition was also apparent between the Antarctic/sub-Antarctic islands and the Antarctic mainland. Bacterial communities were partially shaped by bioclimatic conditions, with 28\\\\% of dominant genera showing habitat preferences connected to at least one of the bioclimatic variables included in our analyses. These genera were also reported as indicator taxa for the ACBRs. \\n\\n\\nConclusions \\nOverall, our data indicate that the current ACBR subdivision of the Antarctic continent does not fully reflect bacterial distribution and diversity in Antarctica. We observed considerable overlap in the structure of soil bacterial communities within the maritime Antarctic region and within the continental Antarctic region. Our results also suggest that bacterial communities might be impacted by regional climatic and other environmental changes. The dataset developed in this study provides a comprehensive baseline that will provide a valuable tool for biodiversity conservation efforts on the continent.

This variability is dominated by the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO), both of which have profound impacts on countries within and well beyond the Pacific. To date, previous studies have only examined a small subset of the possible links between ENSO, its diversity, and the IPO. Here we focus on the statistical relationship between decadal variability in ENSO properties and the IPO, testing the null hypothesis that the IPO arises from random decadal changes in ENSO activity, including ENSO diversity. We use observed sea surface temperature (SST) records since 1920 to investigate how the timing, structure, frequency, duration, and magnitude of El Niño and La Niña events differ between IPO phases. We find that using the relative frequency of El Niño and La Niña events and either the mean event duration or SST magnitude can reproduce up to 60\\\\% of the IPO Tripole Index timeseries. While the spatial SST patterns that represent the IPO and ENSO are similar, the IPO is meridionally broader in the central to eastern Pacific, which may be caused by a lagged relationship with low-frequency SST variability in the equatorial Pacific. In addition, North Pacific SST anomalies of opposite sign to the tropical Pacific SST anomalies is a unique feature of the IPO that cannot be explained by decadal ENSO variability. This suggests a clear IPO and ENSO relationship, but also independence in some of the IPO’s characteristics.', 'doi': '10.1007/s00382-023-07035-8', 'url': 'https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00382-023-07035-8', 'issn': '0930-7575, 1432-0894', 'copyright': 'oa', 'volume': '62', 'title': 'Statistical relationships between the interdecadal {Pacific} oscillation and el niño–southern oscillation', 'ENTRYTYPE': 'article', 'ID': 'heidemann_statistical_2024'}\n",

Despite the increasing use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to acquire high-resolution data for vegetation analysis in Antarctic regions through artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, the use of multispectral imagery and deep learning (DL) is quite limited. This study addresses this gap with two pivotal contributions: (1) it underscores the potential of deep learning (DL) in a field with notably limited implementations for these datasets; and (2) it introduces an innovative workflow that compares the performance between two supervised machine learning (ML) classifiers: Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and U-Net. The proposed workflow is validated by detecting and mapping moss and lichen using data collected in the highly biodiverse Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) 135, situated near Casey Station, between January and February 2023. The implemented ML models were trained against five classes: Healthy Moss, Stressed Moss, Moribund Moss, Lichen, and Non-vegetated. In the development of the U-Net model, two methods were applied: Method (1) which utilised the original labelled data as those used for XGBoost; and Method (2) which incorporated XGBoost predictions as additional input to that version of U-Net. Results indicate that XGBoost demonstrated robust performance, exceeding 85\\\\% in key metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.

Accurately capturing trait diversity is crucial to better understand and predict community assembly, as well as the consequences of global change on community resilience. Existing methods to compute trait turnover have limitations. Trait space approaches based on minimum convex polygons only consider species with extreme trait values. Tree‐based approaches using dendrograms consider all species but distort trait distance between species. More recent trait space methods using complex polytopes try to harmonise the advantages of both methods, but their current implementation has mathematical flaws. \\n\\n\\nWe propose a new kernel integral method (KIM) to compute trait turnover, based on the integration of kernel density estimators (KDEs) rather than using polytopes. We explore how this approach and the computational aspects of the KDE computation can influence the estimates of trait turnover. The novel method is compared with existing ones using justified theoretical expectations for a large number of simulations in which the number of species and the distribution of their traits is controlled for. The practical application of KIM is then demonstrated using data on plant species introduced to the Pacific Islands of French Polynesia. \\n\\n\\nAnalyses on simulated data show that KIM generates results better aligned with theoretical expectations than other methods and is less sensitive to the total number of species. Analyses for French Polynesia data also show that different methods can lead to different conclusions about trait turnover and that the choice of method should be carefully considered based on the research question. \\n\\n\\nThe mathematical properties of methods for computing trait turnover are crucial to consider because they can have important effects on the results, and therefore lead to different conclusions. The novel KIM method provided here generates values that better reflect the distribution of species in trait space than other methods. We therefore recommend using KIM in studies on trait turnover. In contrast, tree‐based approaches should be kept for phylogenetic diversity, as phylogenetic trees will then reflect the speciation process. \\n\\n\\n\\n,  \\nRésumé \\n\\n\\n\\nLa diversité des traits, y compris le renouvellement des traits, qui différencie les rôles des espèces et des communautés par rapport à leurs fonctions, est un composant fondamental de la biodiversité. Capturer avec précision la diversité des traits est crucial pour mieux comprendre et prédire l'assemblage des communautés, ainsi que les conséquences des changements globaux sur la résilience des communautés. Les méthodes existantes pour calculer le renouvellement des traits ont des limites. Les approches basées sur des espaces de traits et utilisant sur des polygones convexes minimums considèrent uniquement la contribution des espèces ayant des valeurs de traits extrêmes. Les approches basées sur des arbres et utilisant des dendrogrammes considèrent toutes les espèces mais déforment la distance entre les espèces calculée à partir de leurs traits. Les méthodes plus récentes basées sur des polytopes complexes tentent d'harmoniser les avantages des deux méthodes, mais leur implémentation actuelle présente des failles mathématiques. \\n\\n\\nNous proposons une nouvelle méthode d'intégrale de noyaux (KIM) pour calculer le renouvellement des traits, basée sur l'intégration d'estimateurs de densité à noyau (KDE) plutôt que sur l'utilisation de polytopes. Nous explorons comment cette approche et les aspects mathématiques du calcul du KDE peuvent influencer les estimations du renouvellement des traits. Cette nouvelle méthode est comparée aux méthodes existantes en utilisant des prédictions théoriques justifiées pour un grand nombre de simulations dans lesquelles le nombre d'espèces et la distribution de leurs traits sont contrôlés. L'application pratique de KIM est ensuite démontrée en utilisant des données sur les espèces végétales introduites dans les îles du Pacifique de la Polynésie française. \\n\\n\\nLes analyses sur des données simulées montrent que KIM génère des résultats mieux alignés sur les prédictions théoriques que les autres méthodes et est moins sensible au nombre total d'espèces. Les analyses des données de Polynésie française montrent également que différentes méthodes peuvent conduire à des conclusions différentes sur le renouvellement des traits, et que le choix de la méthode devrait être soigneusement considéré en fonction de la question de recherche. \\n\\n\\nLes propriétés mathématiques des méthodes de calcul du renouvellement des traits sont cruciales à prendre en compte car elles peuvent avoir des effets importants sur les résultats et donc conduire à des conclusions différentes. La nouvelle méthode KIM présentée ici génère des valeurs qui reflètent mieux la distribution des espèces dans l'espace des traits que d'autres méthodes. Nous recommandons donc d'utiliser KIM dans les études sur le renouvellement des traits. En revanche, les approches basées sur les arbres devraient être conservées pour la diversité phylogénétique, car les arbres phylogénétiques reflètent le processus de spéciation.\", 'doi': '10.1111/2041-210X.14246', 'url': 'https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/2041-210X.14246', 'issn': '2041-210X, 2041-210X', 'copyright': 'oa', 'title': 'A kernel integral method to remove biases in estimating trait turnover', 'ENTRYTYPE': 'article', 'ID': 'latombe_kernel_2024'}\n",

Value of information (VoI) analysis provides a quantitative toolkit for projecting the improved management outcomes expected after making additional measurements. However, traditional VoI analysis reports metrics as expected values (i.e. risk-neutral). This can be problematic because expected values hide uncertainties in projections. The true value of a measurement will only be known after the measurement’s outcome is known, leaving large uncertainty in the measurement’s value before it is performed. As a result, the expected value metrics produced in traditional VoI analysis may not align with the priorities of a risk-averse decision-maker who wants to avoid low-value measurement outcomes. In the present work, we introduce four new VoI metrics that can address a decision-maker’s risk-aversion to different measurement outcomes. We demonstrate the benefits of the new metrics with two ecological case studies for which traditional VoI analysis has been previously applied. In the first case study concerning a test for disease presence at a potential frog translocation site, traditional VoI analysis predicts the test yields an additional expected gain of approximately 10 frogs. However, our new VoI metrics also highlight a 40\\\\% risk that the test is valueless; this knowledge may deter a risk-averse decision-maker from doing the test. In the second case study concerning the design of a trial release prior to a large-scale turtle reintroduction, traditional and new VoI metrics have consistent predictions of which design to choose. However, whilst the best trial release design will increase expected turtle survival in the wild by only 3\\\\%, the new VoI metrics find that this trial design has a 94\\\\% probability of improving the design of the large-scale turtle reintroduction. Using the new metrics, we also demonstrate a clear mathematical link between the often-separated environmental decision-making disciplines of VoI and optimal design of experiments. This mathematical link has the potential to catalyse future collaborations between ecologists and statisticians to work together to quantitatively address environmental decision-making questions of fundamental importance. Overall, the introduced VoI metrics complement existing metrics to provide decision-makers with a comprehensive view of the value of, and risks associated with, a proposed monitoring or measurement activity.

Here, using melt flux estimates and climate variables from the RACMO2.3p3 regional climate model, we show that a decreasing SAM index is associated with increased melt in Dronning Maud Land primarily owing to reduced precipitation and greater absorption of solar radiation. Conversely, in Wilkes Land, a decreasing SAM index corresponds to increased melt because of greater incoming longwave radiation from a warmer atmosphere. We also demonstrate that SAM‐melt correlations are strongest in December as the melt season develops, and that the SAM’s influence on peak melt intensities in January occurs indirectly through the snowmelt‐albedo feedback. Future work must account for such variability in the physical processes underlying the SAM‐melt relationship to reduce uncertainty in surface melt projections.\\n, \\nPlain Language Summary\\nThe Southern Annular Mode (SAM) index describes the strength and location of the westerly winds in the Southern Hemisphere. It has previously been linked to interannual variability in the number of satellite‐observed melt days on the surface of East Antarctica’s floating ice shelves. Here, we use melt estimates from a regional climate model adapted for the polar regions to show that the SAM‐melt relationship is also observed for meltwater fluxes, and to identify the influence of the SAM on the different energy sources driving surface melt. We find that a more negative SAM index (weaker westerlies) is associated with higher air temperatures across most of East Antarctica, and leads to increased incoming longwave radiation and sensible heat fluxes in Wilkes Land. In contrast, in Dronning Maud Land (DML), incoming longwave radiation is unaffected by the SAM, leading to net longwave energy losses, and sensible heat fluxes are reduced because of weaker surface winds. Instead, greater melt in DML is driven through increased absorption of solar radiation, owing to reduced precipitation and a darker surface. We also find differences in the strength of the SAM‐melt relationship on both sub‐seasonal and decadal timescales.\\n, \\nKey Points\\n\\n\\n\\nModeled surface meltwater fluxes on East Antarctic ice shelves are negatively correlated with the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) index\\n\\n\\nMelt fluxes increase for a decreasing SAM index owing to reduced precipitation in Dronning Maud Land, and a warmer atmosphere in Wilkes Land\\n\\n\\nThe SAM‐melt relationship is stronger in December than January, highlighting the importance of the snowmelt‐albedo feedback', 'doi': '10.1029/2023GL105475', 'url': 'https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023GL105475', 'issn': '0094-8276, 1944-8007', 'copyright': 'oa', 'volume': '51', 'title': 'How {Does} the {Southern} {Annular} {Mode} {Control} {Surface} {Melt} in {East} {Antarctica}?', 'ENTRYTYPE': 'article', 'ID': 'saunderson_how_2024'}\n",

Plants depend on hummingbirds for pollination, whereas hummingbirds rely on nectar for food. As a step towards understanding coevolution, this review focuses on the macroevolutionary consequences of plant-hummingbird interactions, a relatively underexplored area in the current literature. We synthesize prior studies, illustrating the origins and dynamics of hummingbird pollination across different angiosperm clades previously pollinated by insects (mostly bees), bats, and passerine birds. In some cases, the crown age of hummingbirds pre-dates the plants they pollinate. In other cases, plant groups transitioned to hummingbird pollination early in the establishment of this bird group in the Americas, with the build-up of both diversities coinciding temporally, and hence suggesting co-diversification. Determining what triggers shifts to and away from hummingbird pollination remains a major open challenge. The impact of hummingbirds on plant diversification is complex, with many tropical plant lineages experiencing increased diversification after acquiring flowers that attract hummingbirds, and others experiencing no change or even a decrease in diversification rates. This mixed evidence suggests that other extrinsic or intrinsic factors, such as local climate and isolation, are important covariables driving the diversification of plants adapted to hummingbird pollination. To guide future studies, we discuss the mechanisms and contexts under which hummingbirds, as a clade and as individual species (e.g. traits, foraging behaviour, degree of specialization), could influence plant evolution. We conclude by commenting on how macroevolutionary signals of the mutualism could relate to coevolution, highlighting the unbalanced focus on the plant side of the interaction, and advocating for the use of species-level interaction data in macroevolutionary studies.\", 'doi': '10.1111/brv.13094', 'url': 'https://doi.org/10.1111/brv.13094', 'issn': '1469-185X', 'copyright': 'oa', 'volume': '99', 'title': 'Macroevolution of the plant-hummingbird pollination system', 'ENTRYTYPE': 'article', 'ID': 'barreto_macroevolution_2024'}\n",

Although the ozone layer is expected to recover before the end of the 21st century, a hole over Antarctica continues to appear each year. Ozone depletion usually peaks between September and October, when fortunately, most Antarctic terrestrial vegetation and soil biota is frozen, dormant and protected under snow cover. Similarly, much marine life is protected by sea ice cover. The ozone hole used to close before the onset of Antarctic summer, meaning that most biota were not exposed to severe springtime UV‐B fluxes. However, in recent years, ozone depletion has persisted into December, which marks the beginning of austral summer. Early summertime ozone depletion is concerning: high incident UV‐B radiation coincident with snowmelt and emergence of vegetation will mean biota is more exposed. The start of summer is also peak breeding season for many animals, thus extreme UV‐B exposure (UV index up to 14) may come at a vulnerable time in their life cycle. Climate change, including changing wind patterns and strength, and particularly declining sea ice, are likely to compound UV‐B exposure of Antarctic organisms, through earlier ice and snowmelt, heatwaves and droughts.

Articulation of these concerns provides a useful basis for an examination of science-based advice in an international governance system founded on peace and science. Therefore, this study provides an evidence-based assessment of SCAR’s operations and history with respect to its interactions with the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties (ATCPs). It shows that the dangers of lack of objectivity by SCAR, or its politicization by one or more of its Members have long been recognised by SCAR, and that SCAR has policies and procedures that are specifically designed to preclude this happening, as might be expected from a reliable international knowledge broker. Evidence-based clarification of SCAR’s interactions with the ATCPs demonstrate that no evidence exists of bias to SCAR’s advice to ATCMs throughout its history. This study therefore shows that concerns about lack of objectivity do not reflect any systematic problems within SCAR.

The Anthropocene, characterized by the importance of\\nHomo sapiens\\nin shaping the Earth system, necessitates a re-evaluation of our understanding and stewardship of ecosystems. This theme issue delves into the multifaceted challenges posed by the ongoing ecological planetary transformation and explores potential solutions across four key subthemes. Firstly, it investigates the functioning and stewardship of emerging novel ecosystems, emphasizing the urgent need to comprehend the dynamics of ecosystems under uncharted conditions. The second subtheme focuses on biodiversity projections under global change, recognizing the necessity of predicting ecological shifts in the Anthropocene. Importantly, the inherent uncertainties and the complexity of ecological responses to environmental stressors pose challenges for societal responses and for accurate projections of ecological change. The RAD framework (resist-accept-direct) is highlighted as a flexible yet nuanced decision-making tool that recognizes the need for adaptive approaches, providing insights for directing and adapting to Anthropocene dynamics while minimizing negative impacts. The imperative to extend our temporal perspective beyond 2100 is emphasized, given the irreversible changes already set in motion. Advancing methods to study ecosystem dynamics under rising biosphere novelty is the subject of the third subtheme. The fourth subtheme emphasizes the importance of integrating human perspectives into understanding, forecasting and managing novel ecosystems. Cultural diversity and biological diversity are intertwined, and the evolving relationship between humans and ecosystems offers lessons for future stewardship. Achieving planetary stewardship in the Anthropocene demands collaboration across scales and integration of ecological and societal perspectives, scalable approaches fit to changing, novel ecological conditions, as well as cultural innovation.\\n\\nThis article is part of the theme issue ‘Ecological novelty and planetary stewardship: biodiversity dynamics in a transforming biosphere’.\", 'doi': '10.1098/rstb.2023.0008', 'url': 'https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2023.0008', 'shorttitle': 'Navigating ecological novelty towards planetary stewardship', 'issn': '0962-8436, 1471-2970', 'copyright': 'oa', 'volume': '379', 'title': 'Navigating ecological novelty towards planetary stewardship: challenges and opportunities in biodiversity dynamics in a transforming biosphere', 'ENTRYTYPE': 'article', 'ID': 'svenning_navigating_2024'}\n",

Marine atmospheric boundary layer (MABL) clouds cover vast areas over the ocean and have important radiative effects on the Earth's climate system. These radiative effects are known to be sensitive to the local organization, or structure, of the mesoscale cellular convection (MCC). A convolutional neural network model is used to identify the two idealized classes of MCC clouds, namely open and closed, over the Southern Ocean (SO) and Northwest Pacific (NP) from high-frequency geostationary Himawari-8 satellite observations. The results of the climatology show that MCC clouds are evenly distributed over the mid-latitude storm tracks for both hemispheres, with peaks poleward of the 40∘ latitude. Open-MCC clouds are more prevalent than closed MCC in both regions. An examination of the presumed meteorological forcing associated with open- and closed-MCC clouds is conducted to illustrate the influence of large-scale meteorological conditions. We establish the importance of the Kuroshio western boundary current in the spatial coverage of open and closed MCC across the NP, presumably through the supply of strong heat and moisture fluxes during marine cold-air outbreaks events. In regions where static stability is higher, we observe a more frequent occurrence of closed MCCs. This behavior contrasts markedly with that of open MCCs, whose formation and persistence are significantly influenced by the difference in temperature between the air and the sea surface. The occurrence frequency of closed MCC over the SO exhibits a significant diurnal cycle, while the diurnal cycle of closed MCC over the NP is less noticeable.\", 'doi': '10.5194/acp-24-1451-2024', 'url': 'https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/24/1451/2024/', 'shorttitle': 'On the relationship between mesoscale cellular convection and meteorological forcing', 'issn': '1680-7324', 'copyright': 'oa', 'volume': '24', 'title': 'On the relationship between mesoscale cellular convection and meteorological forcing: comparing the {Southern} {Ocean} against the {North} {Pacific}', 'ENTRYTYPE': 'article', 'ID': 'lang_relationship_2024'}\n",

Ocean heat content, cryosphere interactions, Antarctic bottom water development and the cloud‐albedo feedbacks need to be understood to form a complete picture of the climate system. However, the high latitude SH is one of the most under‐observed regions due to its remoteness. The advent of satellites and reanalyses have improved our monitoring of this region. Some previous studies observed an increase in precipitation over the SH high latitudes, however we argue that some of the trends in commonly used data sets may be artifacts. We use regression analysis of trends in precipitation and the Southern Annular Mode to contrast these relationships in satellite and reanalysis products, and to evaluate precipitation over the SH. We suggest that sensor changes and the lack of in situ data available for calibration may be responsible for unusual precipitation patterns especially around 65°S.\\n, \\nPlain Language Summary\\nMany important processes in the Earth's climate occur at high latitudes in the Southern Hemisphere. However, due to its remoteness and inhospitable conditions, scientists have trouble obtaining data for this region. Satellites have helped to provide information about this area but are not well constrained due to a lack of in situ data. Sensor changes and the launch of new satellites means that the data can vary in quality and reliability over time. By comparing precipitation trends over the Southern Hemisphere with known climate patterns, we suggest that an observed increase in precipitation over the Southern Hemisphere high latitudes may be due to variations in the satellite technology rather than a physical increase in precipitation.

Parameter inference with these models is difficult because of the presence of cluster-specific random effects, which must be integrated out when evaluating the likelihood function. Here, we propose a sequential variational Bayes algorithm, called Recursive Variational Gaussian Approximation for Latent variable models (R-VGAL), for estimating parameters in GLMMs. The R-VGAL algorithm operates on the data sequentially, requires only a single pass through the data, and can provide parameter updates as new data are collected without the need of re-processing the previous data. At each update, the R-VGAL algorithm requires the gradient and Hessian of a “partial” log-likelihood function evaluated at the new observation, which are generally not available in closed form for GLMMs. To circumvent this issue, we propose using an importance-sampling-based approach for estimating the gradient and Hessian via Fisher’s and Louis’ identities. We find that R-VGAL can be unstable when traversing the first few data points, but that this issue can be mitigated by introducing a damping factor in the initial steps of the algorithm. Through illustrations on both simulated and real datasets, we show that R-VGAL provides good approximations to posterior distributions, that it can be made robust through damping, and that it is computationally efficient.', 'doi': '10.1007/s11222-024-10422-8', 'url': 'https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11222-024-10422-8', 'shorttitle': 'R-{VGAL}', 'issn': '0960-3174, 1573-1375', 'copyright': 'oa', 'volume': '34', 'title': 'R-{VGAL}: a sequential variational {Bayes} algorithm for generalised linear mixed models', 'ENTRYTYPE': 'article', 'ID': 'vu_r-vgal_2024'}\n",

It is connected to all of Earth’s surface ecosystems and plays an important role in microbial dispersal on local to global scales. Despite this grand scale, surprisingly little is understood about the atmosphere itself as a habitat. A key question remains unresolved: does the atmosphere simply transport microorganisms from one location to another, or does it harbor adapted, resident, and active microbial communities that overcome the physiological stressors and selection pressures the atmosphere poses to life? Advances in extreme microbiology and astrobiology continue to push our understanding of the limits of life towards ever greater extremes of temperature, pressure, salinity, irradiance, pH, and water availability. Earth’s atmosphere stands as a challenging, but potentially surmountable, extreme environment to harbour living, active, resident microorganisms. Here we confront the current understanding of the atmosphere as a microbial habitat, highlighting key advances and limitations. We pose major ecological and mechanistic questions about microbial life in the atmosphere that remain unresolved and frame the problems and technical pitfalls that have largely hindered recent developments in this space, providing evidence-based insights to drive future research in this field.

It has been proposed that this bi-polar seesaw is the result of climate system feedbacks. A key debate, which remains unresolved, concerns the relative roles of the atmosphere and oceans in transmitting these climate responses between the hemispheres. In this study we present quantitative climate proxy data to show that air temperatures in New Zealand, as recorded by mountain glaciers, tracked millennial-scale warming and cooling of local surface temperatures of the adjacent Tasman Sea throughout the last glacial termination. Both realms were dominated by warming between 18 ka and 12 ka, interrupted by a multi-centennial to millennial-scale cooling event centred on 14 ka, coincident with the Antarctic Cold Reversal. Reconciling our climate proxy evidence with a transient climate model simulation of the glacial termination, we find that the timing and amplitude of temperature changes are consistent with changing Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC). The southwest Pacific region displays a particularly sensitive response to AMOC intensity changes, despite its far-field situation from the North Atlantic. This sensitivity represents the combined impact of fast-acting oceanic teleconnections and regional atmosphere-ocean response associated with changes to the southern westerly winds.

However, accurately quantifying the rate at which species are introduced into new regions remains a challenge due to the confounding effect of observation efforts on discovery records. Despite the recognition of this issue, most analyses are still based on raw discovery records, leading to biased inferences. In this study, we evaluate different models for estimating introduction rates, including new models that use auxiliary data on observation effort, and identify their strengths and weaknesses.\\n\\n\\nInnovation\\n\\nWe compare four models: (1) a\\nnaïve model\\nwhich assumes perfect detection; (2) a model proposed by Solow and Costello (the\\nS\\\\&C model\\n); (3)\\nconstant detection model\\n: a modified version of the S\\\\&C model with constant detection probabilities and (4)\\na novel sampling proxy model\\n: a model that uses external data on observation effort.

Under simulated scenarios of high detection, the naïve model is usually the best‐performing model, but it falls short when detection is low. Moreover, we find that in simulations which most likely mimic most real‐world cases (i.e. non‐monotonic probability of detection), incorporating external data on observation effort using the sampling proxy model, substantially improve estimates. This highlights the importance of considering observation effort when estimating introduction rates of alien species.

For 202 metacommunity datasets (archipelagos, habitat islands and fragments) we regressed MSLIP on patch size, testing four hypotheses: (i) no effect (zero slope), (ii) more widespread species in smaller patches (negative slope), (iii) more narrow‐range species in smaller patches (positive slope), (iv) a composite effect (curvilinear/unimodal).\\n\\n\\nResults\\nThere was a generally negative curvilinear relationship between MSLIP and patch size, consistent with smaller and larger patches respectively containing more high‐ and low‐incidence species than expected.

For example, birds often target fruits that match their beak size because those fruits can be consumed more efficiently. We hypothesized that pressure to optimize diet—measured as matching between fruit and beak size—increases under stressful environments, such as those that determine species’ range edges. Using fruit-consumption and trait information for 97 frugivorous bird and 831 plant species across six continents, we demonstrate that birds feed more frequently on closely size-matched fruits near their geographic range limits. This pattern was particularly strong for highly frugivorous birds, whereas opportunistic frugivores showed no such tendency.

Here we argue that cost‐benefit analysis is an ideal lens to assess the value of model complexity in fisheries management. While some studies have reported the benefits of model complexity in fisheries, modeling costs are rarely considered. In the absence of cost data in the literature, we report, as a starting point, relative costs of single‐species stock assessment and marine ecosystem models from two Australian organizations.

In drought-prone Australia, multi-year droughts have detrimental impacts on both the natural environment and human societies. For responsible water management, we need a thorough understanding of the full range of variability in multi-year droughts and how this might change in a warming world. But research into the long-term frequency, persistence, and severity of Australian droughts is limited. This is partly due to the length of the observational record, which is short relative to the timescales of hydroclimatic variability and hence may not capture the range of possible variability. Using simulations of Australian precipitation over the full past millennium (850–2000), we characterise the nature of multi-year meteorological droughts across Australia and include a particular focus on the Murray–Darling Basin\\xa0(MDB), the largest agricultural region in Australia. We find that simulated Australian droughts in the 20th\\xa0century (1900–2000) are within the bounds of pre-industrial natural variability in terms of drought intensity, severity, and frequency. A tendency for droughts to last longer in southwestern and eastern Australia (including the MDB) in the 20th\\xa0century, compared with the pre-industrial period, suggests an emerging anthropogenic influence, consistent with projected rainfall changes in these regions. Large volcanic eruptions tend to promote drought-free intervals in the MDB. Model simulations of droughts over the last millennium suggest that future droughts across Australia could be much longer than what was experienced in the 20th\\xa0century, even without any human influence.

However, the impact that subglacial freshwater has on driving the evolution of the dynamic outlet glaciers that drain this basin has yet to be tested in a coupled ice sheet‐subglacial hydrology numerical modeling framework. Here, we project the evolution of the primary outlet glaciers draining the ASB (Moscow University Ice Shelf, Totten, Vanderford, and Adams Glaciers) in response to an evolving subglacial hydrology system and to ocean forcing through 2100, following low and high CMIP6 emission scenarios. By 2100, ice‐hydrology feedbacks enhance the ASB's 2100 sea level contribution by ∼30\\\\% (7.50–9.80\\xa0mm) in high emission scenarios and accelerate the retreat of Totten Glacier's main ice stream by 25\\xa0years. Ice‐hydrology feedbacks are particularly influential in the retreat of the Vanderford and Adams Glaciers, driving an additional 10\\xa0km of retreat in fully coupled simulations relative to uncoupled simulations. Hydrology‐driven ice shelf melt enhancements are the primary cause of domain‐wide mass loss in low emission scenarios, but are secondary to ice sheet frictional feedbacks under high emission scenarios. The results presented here demonstrate that ice‐subglacial hydrology interactions can significantly accelerate retreat of dynamic Antarctic glaciers and that future Antarctic sea level assessments that do not take these interactions into account might be severely underestimating Antarctic Ice Sheet mass loss.\\n, \\nPlain Language Summary\\nRecent studies have revealed that ice sheet basal meltwater flows beneath a large sector of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet that contains enough ice to raise global sea levels by ∼7\\xa0m if it were to all melt. Here, we develop a coupled ice sheet and subglacial hydrology model and use it to simulate the evolution of a large East Antarctic basin through 2100 under low and high climate forcing scenarios. Interactions between the ice sheet and the subglacial freshwater system cause this sector of East Antarctica to contribute 30\\\\% more to global sea level rise by 2100 in high emission scenarios. In addition, these interactions also drive accelerated retreat of up to 10\\xa0km of the coastal outlet glaciers that drain this ice sheet sector. Overall, we find that freshwater flowing beneath the Antarctic Ice Sheet can significantly accelerate retreat and the subsequent global sea level rise contribution of Antarctica's vulnerable outlet glaciers. Modeling studies that have attempted to quantify Antarctica's future contribution to global sea level have yet to take into account these ice sheet‐freshwater interactions, which may lead to an underestimate in future sea levels.\\n, \\nKey Points\\n\\n\\n\\nThe 21st century evolution of the Aurora Subglacial Basin is modeled in a coupled ice sheet‐subglacial hydrology model\\n\\n\\nIce‐hydrology feedbacks accelerate projected grounding line retreat and mass loss of coastal outlet glaciers\\n\\n\\nEnhanced ocean melt due to subglacial discharge is particularly influential under cooler ocean temperatures\", 'doi': '10.1029/2023JF007513', 'url': 'https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023JF007513', 'issn': '2169-9003, 2169-9011', 'volume': '129', 'title': 'Subglacial {Discharge} {Accelerates} {Dynamic} {Retreat} of {Aurora} {Subglacial} {Basin} {Outlet} {Glaciers}, {East} {Antarctica}, {Over} the 21st {Century}', 'ENTRYTYPE': 'article', 'ID': 'pelle_subglacial_2024'}\n",

However, according to contemporary scholars, Antarctic Treaty decision‐making is becoming increasingly unresponsive to the rising environmental challenges in the region. We assessed the performance of Antarctic Treaty decision‐making by measuring the rate and diversity of decision‐making over the last 6 decades. To measure the rate, we counted the number of inputs and outputs of ATCMs and calculated the time taken for legally binding outputs to enter into force. To measure diversity, we calculated the range of topics addressed by the inputs and outputs of ATCMs. The average number of agreements reached per ATCM increased from 1961 to 2022. Although the diversity of Antarctic topics discussed at ATCMs remained consistently high, the diversity of topics on which legally binding agreements were adopted declined significantly. Antarctic issues—including those of highest priority—are now almost entirely dealt with through nonbinding, soft‐law agreements. It is plausible that this move away from binding decisions reflects a dynamic governance institution evolving to respond to new pressures. However, we suggest that the change reveals a concerning shift in decision‐making behavior and performance, unique to the treaty's history. Soft law is beneficial in some cases, but its overuse diminishes accountability and transparency, significantly reducing the parties’ abilities to understand and measure their performance, including the outcomes and impacts of decisions. Although the rate and diversity of ATCM inputs and outputs provide only a partial view of decision‐making performance, the exploration of these metrics provides a foundation for asking essential questions about the impacts of Antarctic Treaty governance on the region's environmental protection and conservation.\\n, \\n\\n\\nMedida del desempeño de las decisiones del Tratado Antártico\\n\\nResumen\\nLos acuerdos logrados en las Reuniones Consultivas del Tratado Antártico (RCTA) son uno de los principales medios para abordar las cuestiones de conservación y protección ambiental de la Antártida. Sin embargo, según los académicos contemporáneos, la toma de decisiones del Tratado Antártico es cada vez menos receptiva a los crecientes retos ambientales de la región. Evaluamos el rendimiento de las decisiones del Tratado Antártico con la medida del ritmo y la diversidad de la toma de decisiones en las últimas seis décadas. Para medir el ritmo, contamos el número de entradas y salidas de las RCTA y calculamos el tiempo que tardan en entrar en vigor los resultados con vinculación jurídica. Para medir la diversidad, calculamos la gama de temas abordados por las entradas y salidas de las RCTA. El número medio de acuerdos alcanzados por cada RCTA aumentó de 1961 a 2022. Sin embargo, mientras que la diversidad de temas antárticos debatidos en las RCTA se mantuvo constantemente alta, la diversidad de temas sobre los que se adoptaron acuerdos con vinculación jurídica disminuyó significativamente. Las cuestiones antárticas ‐incluidas las de máxima prioridad‐ se abordan ahora casi en su totalidad mediante acuerdos no vinculantes y de derecho indicativo. Es plausible que este alejamiento de las decisiones vinculantes refleje una institución de gestión dinámica que evoluciona para responder a nuevas presiones. Sin embargo, sugerimos que el cambio revela una modificación preocupante en el comportamiento y los resultados de la toma de decisiones, único en la historia del tratado. El derecho indicativo es benéfico en algunos casos, pero su uso excesivo disminuye la responsabilidad y la transparencia, lo que reduce significativamente la capacidad de las partes para comprender y medir su rendimiento, incluidos los resultados y los impactos de las decisiones. Aunque la tasa y la diversidad de las entradas y salidas de las RCTA sólo proporcionan una visión parcial del rendimiento de la toma de decisiones, la exploración de estas métricas proporciona una base para plantear preguntas esenciales sobre los impactos de la gestión del Tratado Antártico para la protección y conservación ambiental de la región.\\n\\n\\n, \\n【摘要】\\n\\n南极条约协商会议 (Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting, ATCM) 所达成的协议是解决南极保护和环境问题的主要手段之一。然而, 有当代学者提出, 《南极条约》的决策越来越无法应对该地区日益严峻的环境挑战。本研究通过分析过去六十年来ATCM决策的速度和多样性, 评估了《南极条约》的决策成效。为衡量速度, 我们统计了ATCM的投入和产出数量, 并计算了具有法律约束力的产出生效所需的时间。为衡量多样性, 我们计算了ATCM投入和产出所涉及的主题范围。结果显示, 从1961年到2022年, 每个ATCM达成协议的平均数量有所增加。然而, 虽然在ATCM中讨论的南极议题的多样性一直很高, 但会议通过的具有法律约束力的协议的议题多样性却显著下降。南极问题——包括那些最优先的问题——现在几乎完全通过不具约束力的软法律协定来处理。这种制定不具法律约束力决策的做法似乎反映出一个动态的管理机构正在不断发展, 以应对新的压力。但我们认为, 这一变化揭示了决策行为和成效方面令人担忧的转变, 这在条约历史上是仅有的案例。软法律在某些情况下是有益的, 但其过度使用会削弱问责制和透明度, 显著降低缔约方了解和衡量其成效的能力, 包括决策的结果和影响。虽然ATCM投入和产出的速度和多样性仅提供了决策成效的部分视角, 但分析这些指标为提出有关《南极条约》管理对该地区环境保护影响的基本问题奠定了基础。\\n【翻译: 胡怡思; 审校: 聂永刚】\", 'doi': '10.1111/cobi.14349', 'url': 'https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cobi.14349', 'issn': '0888-8892, 1523-1739', 'copyright': 'oa', 'title': 'Measuring the performance of {Antarctic} {Treaty} decision‐making', 'ENTRYTYPE': 'article', 'ID': 'gardiner_measuring_2024'}\n",

However, VoI studies frequently suggest that collecting more data will not substantially improve management outcomes. This often contradicts the intuition of ecologists and managers who usually believe new information is critical for management. This inconsistency is exacerbated by the perception that VoI is a black‐box method. A lack of understanding as to why VoI is usually lower than ecologists expect is hampering on‐ground uptake. There is an urgent need to identify the factors that drive VoI methodology to produce low values.\\n\\n\\nHere, we use a rigorous approach to provide insights into why VoI values are often low. We first derive analytic solutions and upper bounds for a VoI problem with two uncertain states, two actions, and four management outcomes. We show how VoI changes with respect to the benefit (i.e. utility) of implementing actions in each state, and the probability the system is in each state. We apply our formulation to a published frog population management case study and extend the results numerically to 10 million randomly generated larger‐sized problems.\\n\\n\\nZero VoI occurred half of the time in our two‐action two‐state simulations, corresponding to when one action is best, or equal best, across all states. Even when VoI values were positive, they were typically low. However, on average, VoI tended to increase with the number of states and actions. Our analytic expression for VoI, in the case where VoI is positive, demonstrates that VoI is characterized by the state probabilities and, the utility gaps, that is the difference in utility of deploying each action in each state. Our derived bounds reveal that, in all two‐action two‐state systems, VoI cannot be larger than half the largest utility gap.\\n\\n\\nOur simple, yet powerful, analysis provides precious insight into the important factors that drive VoI analysis.

Early observations suggested that the relationship was positive, implying that globally widespread species hold the rarest combinations of traits. Here, we formally describe and test the relationship in the world's birds and consider its implications for global functional diversity and redundancy. We demonstrate that the relationship is best described as triangular with a positive upper boundary, with its linear model significance lost when including phylogenetic effects. The triangular relationship is formed by groups of phylogenetically related widespread species with moderate and high trait distinctiveness. Decomposing the relationship further using quantile regression highlights the unique traits of these widespread birds. Overall, the triangular relationship emphasises that while not all widespread species have rare trait combinations, those that do should not be overlooked in conservation efforts, regardless of their current threat status.\", 'doi': '10.1111/ele.14552', 'url': 'https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ele.14552', 'issn': '1461-023X, 1461-0248', 'copyright': 'oa', 'volume': '27', 'title': \"Global {Avian} {Functional} {Diversity} {Depends} on the {World}'s {Most} {Widespread} and {Distinct} {Birds}\", 'ENTRYTYPE': 'article', 'ID': 'affleck_global_2024'}\n",

This paper provides a comprehensive review of UAV path planning, obstacle detection, and avoidance methods, with a focus on its utilisation in both single and multiple UAV platforms. The paper classifies the algorithms into two main categories: (1) global and local path-planning approaches in single UAVs; and (2) multi-UAV path-planning methods. It further analyses obstacle detection and avoidance methods, as well as their capacity to adapt, optimise, and compute efficiently in different operational environments. The outcomes highlight the advantages and limitations of each method, offering valuable information regarding their suitability for remote sensing applications, such as precision agriculture, urban mapping, and ecological surveillance. Additionally, this review also identifies limitations in the existing research, specifically in multi-UAV frameworks, and provides recommendations for future developments to improve the adaptability and effectiveness of UAV operations in dynamic and complex situations.', 'doi': '10.3390/rs16214019', 'url': 'https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/16/21/4019', 'issn': '2072-4292', 'copyright': 'oa', 'volume': '16', 'title': 'A {Review} of {UAV} {Path}-{Planning} {Algorithms} and {Obstacle} {Avoidance} {Methods} for {Remote} {Sensing} {Applications}', 'ENTRYTYPE': 'article', 'ID': 'debnath_review_2024'}\n"
